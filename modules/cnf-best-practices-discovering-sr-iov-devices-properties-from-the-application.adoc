= Discovering SR-IOV devices properties from the application

All the properties of the interfaces are added to the pod's `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation. The annotation is json-formatted and for each network object contains information such as IPs (where available), MAC address, PCI address. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status: |-
  [{
      "name": "",
      "interface": "eth0",
      "ips": [
        "10.132.3.148"
        ],
      "mac": "0a:58:0a:84:03:94",
      "default": true,
      "dns": {}
   }]
----

[NOTE]
====
the IP information is not available if the driver specified is `vf-io`.
====

The same annotation is available as a file content inside the pod, at the `/etc/podnetinfo/annotations` path. A convenience library is available to easily consume those informations from the application (bindings in C and Go).
