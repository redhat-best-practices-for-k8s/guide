= Pod exit status

The most basic requirement for the lifecycle management of pods in OpenShift is the ability to start and stop correctly. When starting up, health probes like liveness and readiness checks can be put into place to ensure the application is functioning properly.

There are different ways a pod can be stopped in Kubernetes. One way is that the pod can remain alive but non-functional. Another way is that the pod can crash and become non-functional. In the first case, if the administrator has implemented liveness and readiness checks, OpenShift can stop the pod and either restart it on the same node or a different node in the cluster. For the second case, when the application in the pod stops, it should exit with a code and write suitable log entries to help the administrator diagnose what the issue was that caused the problem.

Pods should use `terminationMessagePolicy: FallbackToLogsOnError` to summarize why they crashed and use stderr to report errors on crash

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#observability-termination-policy[observability-termination-policy]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Incorrect termination message policies can prevent proper error reporting and make failure diagnosis difficult.

====
All pods shall have a liveness, readiness and startup probes defined

See test cases link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-liveness-probe[lifecycle-liveness-probe], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-readiness-probe[lifecycle-readiness-probe], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-startup-probe[lifecycle-startup-probe]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Missing liveness probes prevent Kubernetes from detecting and recovering from application deadlocks and hangs. Missing readiness probes can cause traffic to be routed to non-ready pods, resulting in failed requests and poor user experience. Missing startup probes can cause slow-starting applications to be killed prematurely, preventing successful application startup.
