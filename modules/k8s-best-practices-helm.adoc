= Helm v3

Helm v3 is a serverless mechanism for defining templates that describe a complete Kubernetes application. This allows you to build generic templates for applications that you can use with site or deployment specific values to be provided as inputs to the template.
Helm is roughly analogous to HEAT templates in the OpenStack environment.

For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/working_with_helm_charts/understanding-helm.html[Understanding Helm].

====
If you use Helm to deploy your application, you must use Helm v3 because of security issues with Helm v2.
