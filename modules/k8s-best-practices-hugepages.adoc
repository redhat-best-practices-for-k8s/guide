= Huge pages

In OpenShift Container Platform, nodes/hosts must pre-allocate huge pages.

For more information, see
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/what-huge-pages-do-and-how-they-are-consumed-by-apps.html[Configuring huge pages].


To request hugepages, pods must supply the following within the `pod.spec` for each container:

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  limits:
    hugepages-2Mi: 100Mi
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "1"
  requests:
    hugepages-2Mi: 100Mi
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "1"
----

See test cases link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#platform-alteration-hugepages-2m-only[platform-alteration-hugepages-2m-only], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#platform-alteration-hugepages-config[platform-alteration-hugepages-config]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Using inappropriate hugepage sizes can cause memory allocation failures and reduce overall system performance and stability.
