= Huge pages allocation

Unlike CPU or memory, huge pages do not support overcommit. Huge page requests must equal the limits. Huge pages are isolated at a container scope, so each container has its own limit on their cgroup sandbox as requested in a container spec. Applications that consume huge pages via `shmget()` with `SHM_HUGETLB` must run with a supplemental group that matches `/proc/sys/vm/hugetlb_shm_group`. Huge page usage in a namespace is controllable via ResourceQuota similar to other compute resources like cpu or memory using the hugepages-1Gi token.
