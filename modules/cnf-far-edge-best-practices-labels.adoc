= Labels

Labels are used to organize and select subsets of objects. For example, labels enable a service to find and direct traffic to an appropriate pod. While pods can come and go, when labeled appropriately, the service will detect new pods, or a lack of pods, and forward or reduce the traffic accordingly.

When designing your label scheme, it might make sense to map applications as types, location, departments, roles, etc. The scheduler will then use these attributes when colocating pods or spreading the pods out amongst the cluster. It is also possible to search for resources by label.
