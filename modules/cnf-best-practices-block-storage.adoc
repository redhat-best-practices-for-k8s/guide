= Block Storage

OpenShift Container Platform can provision raw block volumes. These volumes do not have a file system, and can provide performance benefits for applications that either write to the disk directly or implement their own storage service.

There are 2 types of storage connectivity and 2 levels of storage in each. All block storage is located on a NetApp appliance.

The two types of storage connectivity are:

NFS:: is the default storage type

iSCSI:: storage should only be used for database type applications
