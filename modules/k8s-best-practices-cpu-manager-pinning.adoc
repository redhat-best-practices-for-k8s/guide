The OpenShift platform can use the Kubernetes CPU Manager to support allocation of cores using kubernetes guaranteed QoS class for applications. Isolcpus is not enabled.

Important note on using probes: If the CNF is running a DPDK process do not use exec probes (executing a command within the container) as it may pile up and block the
node eventually.

Workload Requirement: If a workload is doing CPU pinning, exec probes may not be used.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#networking-dpdk-cpu-pinning-exec-probe[networking-dpdk-cpu-pinning-exec-probe]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Exec probes on CPU-pinned DPDK workloads can cause performance degradation, interrupt real-time operations, and potentially crash applications due to resource contention.
