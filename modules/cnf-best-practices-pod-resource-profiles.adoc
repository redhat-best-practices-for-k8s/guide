= Pod resource requests

CaaS Platform has a default scheduler that is responsible for being aware of the current available resources on the platform, and placing containers / applications on the platform appropriately.

All pods should have a resource request that is the minimum amount of resources the pod is expected to use at steady state for both memory and CPU.
