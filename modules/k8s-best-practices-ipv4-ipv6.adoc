= IPv4 & IPv6

Applications should discover services via DNS by doing an AAAA and A query. If an application gets a AAAA response the application should prefer using the IPv6 address in the AAAA response for application sockets.

In OpenShift Container Platform 4.7+, you can declare `ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack` which will present an IPv4 and IPv6 address in the service.

.Workload recommendation
[IMPORTANT]
====
IPv4 should only be used inside a pod when absolutely necessary.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#networking-icmpv4-connectivity[networking-icmpv4-connectivity]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Failure indicates potential network isolation issues that could prevent workload components from communicating, leading to service degradation or complete application failure.

.Workload recommendation
[IMPORTANT]
====
Services should be created as IPv6 only services wherever possible. If an application requires dual stack it should create a dual stack service.

See test cases link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#networking-dual-stack-service[networking-dual-stack-service], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#networking-icmpv6-connectivity[networking-icmpv6-connectivity]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Single-stack IPv4 services limit network architecture flexibility and prevent migration to modern dual-stack infrastructures.

To configure IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack, set dual-stack cluster network assignments:

[source,yaml]
----
kube-apiserver:
  --service-cluster-ip-range=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>
