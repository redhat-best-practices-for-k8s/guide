= Pod permissions

By default, pods should not expect to be permitted to run as root. Pod restrictions are enforced by SCC within the OpenShift platform. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html[Managing security context constraints].

Pods will execute on worker nodes, by default being admitted to the cluster with the "restricted" SCC.

The "restricted" SCC:

* Ensures that no containers within the pod can run with the `allowPrivilegedContainer` flag set.

* Ensures that pods cannot mount host directory volumes. 

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-pod-host-path[access-control-pod-host-path]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Host path mounts can expose sensitive host files to containers, enable container escape attacks, and compromise host system integrity.

* Requires that a pod run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs from the namespace annotation.

* Requires that a pod run with a pre-allocated MCS label from the namespace annotation.

* Allows pods to use any supplemental group.

Any pods requiring elevated privileges must document the required capabilities driven by application syscalls and a process to validate the requirements must occur.
