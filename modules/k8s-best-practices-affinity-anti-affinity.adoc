= Affinity and anti-affinity

In OpenShift Container Platform pod affinity and pod anti-affinity allow you to constrain which nodes your pod are eligible to be scheduled based on the key/value labels on other pods. There are two types of affinity rules, required and preferred. Required rules must be met, whereas preferred rules are best effort.

These pod affinity/anti-affinity rules are set in the pod specification as `matchExpressions` to a `labelSelector`. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity.html[Placing pods relative to other pods using affinity and anti-affinity rules] for more information. The following example `Pod` CR illustrates pod affinity:

.Workload requirement
[IMPORTANT]
====
Pods that need to be co-located on the same node need affinity rules. Pods that should not be
co-located for resiliency purposes require anti-affinity rules.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-affinity-required-pods[lifecycle-affinity-required-pods]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Missing affinity rules can cause incorrect pod placement, leading to performance issues and failure to meet co-location requirements.

.Workload requirement
[IMPORTANT]
====
Pods that perform the same microservice and could be disrupted if multiple members of the service are
unavailable must implement affinity/anti-affinity group rules or spread the pods across nodes to prevent disruption in the event of node failures, patches, or upgrades.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-pod-high-availability[lifecycle-pod-high-availability]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Missing anti-affinity rules can cause all pod replicas to be scheduled on the same node, creating single points of failure.
