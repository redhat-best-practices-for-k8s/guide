= Cloud-native design best practices

The following best practices highlight some key principles of cloud-native application design.

Single purpose w/messaging interface::
A container should address a single purpose with a well-defined (typically RESTful API) messaging interface. The motivation here is that such a container image is more reusable and more replaceable/upgradeable.

High observability::
A container must provide APIs for the platform to observe the container health and act accordingly. These APIs include health checks (liveness and readiness), logging to stderr and stdout for log aggregation (by tools such as `Logstash` or `Filebeat`), and integrate with tracing and metrics-gathering libraries (such as `Prometheus` or `Metricbeat`).

Lifecycle conformance::
A container must receive important events from the platform and conform/react to these events properly. For example, a container should catch SIGTERM or SIGKILL from the platform and shut down as quickly as possible. Other typically important events from the platform are PostStart to initialize before servicing requests and PreStop to release resources cleanly before shutting down.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-container-poststart[lifecycle-container-poststart]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Missing PostStart hooks can cause containers to start serving traffic before proper initialization, leading to application errors.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-container-prestop[lifecycle-container-prestop]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Missing PreStop hooks can cause ungraceful shutdowns, data loss, and connection drops during container termination.

Image immutability::
Container images are meant to be immutable; i.e. customized images for different environments should typically not be built. Instead, an external means for storing and retrieving configurations that vary across environments for the container should be used. Additionally, the container image should NOT dynamically install additional packages at runtime.

Process disposability::
Containers should be as ephemeral as possible and ready to be replaced by another container instance at any point in time. There are many reasons to replace a container, such as failing a health check, scaling down the application, migrating the containers to a different host, platform resource starvation, or another issue.
+
This means that containerized applications must keep their state externalized or distributed and redundant. To store files or block level data, persistent volume claims should be used. For information such as user sessions, use of an external, low-latency, key-value store such as redis should be used. Process disposability also requires that the application should be quick in starting up and shutting down, and even be ready for a sudden, complete hardware failure.
+
Another helpful practice in implementing this principle is to create small containers. Containers in cloud-native environments may be automatically scheduled and started on different hosts. Having smaller containers leads to quicker start-up times because before being restarted, containers need to be physically copied to the host system.
+
A corollary of this practice is to "retry instead of crashing", for example, When one service in your application depends on another service, it should not crash when the other service is unreachable. For example, your API service is starting up and detects the database is unreachable. Instead of failing and refusing to start, you design it to retry the connection. While the database connection is down the API can respond with a 503 status code, telling the clients that the service is currently unavailable. This practice should already be followed by applications, but if you are working in a containerized environment where instances are disposable, then the need for it becomes more obvious.
+
Also related to this, by default containers are launched with shared images using COW filesystems which only exist as long as the container exists. Mounting Persistent Volume Claims enables a container to have persistent physical storage. Clearly defining the abstraction for what storage is persisted promotes the idea that instances are disposable.
