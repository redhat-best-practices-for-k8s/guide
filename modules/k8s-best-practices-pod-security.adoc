= Pod security

SELinux should always be enabled within the OpenShift Container Platform and will be used to enforce syscalls that containers make. In addition, Kubernetes has another native function called pod security policies.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#platform-alteration-is-selinux-enforcing[platform-alteration-is-selinux-enforcing]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Non-enforcing SELinux reduces security isolation and can allow privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized resource access.
