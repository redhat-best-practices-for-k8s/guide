= Container storage (CSI)

Pod volumes are supported via local storage and the CSI for persistent volumes. Local storage is truly ephemeral storage, it is local only to the physical node that a pod is running on and is lost when a pod is killed and recreated. If a pod requires persistent storage, the CSI can be used via Kubernetes native primitives `persistentVolume` (`PV`) and `persistentVolumeClaim` (`PVC`) to get persistent storage, such as an NFS share via the CSI backed by NetApp Trident.

When using storage with Kubernetes, you can use storage classes. Refer to <<k8s-best-practices-block-storage>> for a description of the available storage classes. Using storage classes, you can create volumes based on the parameters of the required storage.

Workloads should clear persistent storage by deleting the associated `PV` resources when removing the application from a cluster.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-persistent-volume-reclaim-policy[lifecycle-persistent-volume-reclaim-policy]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Incorrect reclaim policies can lead to data persistence after application removal, causing storage waste and potential data security issues.
