= Image tagging

An image tag is a label applied to a container image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image from other images. Image tags may be used to categorize images (for example: latest, stable, development) and by versions within the categories. This allows the administrator to be specific when declaring which image to test, or which image to run in production.
