= Image tagging

An image tag is a label applied to a container image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image from other images. Image tags may be used to categorize images (for example: latest, stable, development) and by versions within the categories. This allows the administrator to be specific when declaring which image to test, or which image to run in production.

See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/managing_images/tagging-images.html[Tagging Images]

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#manageability-containers-image-tag[manageability-containers-image-tag]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Missing image tags make it difficult to track versions, perform rollbacks, and maintain deployment consistency.
