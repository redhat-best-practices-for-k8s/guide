Log aggregation and analysis::
--
* Containers are expected to write logs to stdout. It is highly recommended that stdout/stderr leverage some standard logging format for output.
+
* Logs CAN be parsed to a limited extent so that specific vendor logs can be sent back to the workload if required.
+
* Workloads requiring log parsing must leverage some standard logging library or format for all stdout/stderr. Examples of standard logging libraries include; `klog`, `rfc5424`, and `oslo`.

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Improper logging configuration prevents log aggregation and monitoring, making troubleshooting and debugging difficult.
