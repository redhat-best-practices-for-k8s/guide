= Attaching the VF to a pod

Once the right network attachment definition is found, applying the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation with the name of the network attachment definition to the pod will add the additional network interfaces in the pod namespace, as per the following example:

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: |-
      [
        {
          "name": "net1",
          "mac": "20:04:0f:f1:88:01",
          "ips": ["192.168.10.1/24", "2001::1/64"]
         }
      ]
