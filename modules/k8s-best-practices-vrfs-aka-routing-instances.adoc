= VRFs (aka routing instances)

Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) provides a way to have separate routing tables on the device enabling multiple L3 routing domains concurrently. This allows for traffic in different VRF to be treated independently of each other.

Generally a Load Balancer is used within the platform for L4 services and sometimes L7 load balancing services.
In a multi-tenant environment, Network Functions (NFs) can be deployed within a single namespace.
Supporting applications like an OAM platform for multiple NFs from the same vendor should be
run in an additional separate namespace.
The CNI interface should be used as the default mechanism for accessing VRFs. For
traffic inbound to an application this is done through allocation of a VIP on the load balancer via
the Kubernetes API on the appropriate VRF. For traffic outbound from an application selection of
the VRF is done on the application's behalf via the Load Balancer and destination routing.
Multus will be supported within the platform for additional NICs within containers. However
Multus should be used only for those cases that cannot be supported by the load balancer.

The POD and Services networks are unrouted address space, they are only reachable via service
VIPs on the load balancers. The POD network will be NATed as traffic egresses the load balancer.
Traffic inbound will be destination NATed to Service/Pod IP addresses.


Applications should use Network Policies for firewalling the application. Network Policies should
be written with a default deny and only allow ports and protocols on an as needed basis for any
pods and services.

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Without default deny-all network policies, workloads are exposed to lateral movement attacks and unauthorized network access, compromising security posture and potentially enabling data breaches.
