= Automount services for pods

Pods which do not require API access should set the value of `automountServiceAccountToken` to false within the pod spec, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: examplesvcacct
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
----

Pods must include an explicit `serviceAccountName` in the pod spec. This is required to ensure that the pod is not automatically assigned the default service account.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-pod-automount-service-account-token[access-control-pod-automount-service-account-token]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Auto-mounted service account tokens expose Kubernetes API credentials to application code, creating potential attack vectors if applications are compromised.
