= Avoid the host network namespace

Application pods must avoid using `hostNetwork`. Applications may not use the host network, including `nodePort` for network communication. Any networking needs beyond the functions provided by the pod network and ingress/egress proxy must be serviced via a MULTUS connected interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Applications may not use `NodePorts` or the `hostNetwork`.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-service-type[access-control-service-type]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** NodePort services expose applications directly on host ports, creating security risks and potential port conflicts with host services.
