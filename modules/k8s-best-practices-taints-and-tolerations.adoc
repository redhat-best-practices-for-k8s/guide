= Taints and tolerations

Taints and tolerations allow the node to control which pods are scheduled on the node. A taint allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching toleration.

You apply taints to a node through the node specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the pod specification (`PodSpec`). A taint on a node instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.

Taints and tolerations consist of a key, value, and effect. An operator allows you to leave one of these parameters empty.

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Tainted kernels indicate unauthorized modifications that can introduce instability, security vulnerabilities, and support issues.
