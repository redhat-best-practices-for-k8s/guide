= Workload security

In OCP, it is possible to run privileged containers that have all of the root capabilities on a host machine, allowing the ability to access resources which are not accessible in ordinary containers. This, however, increases the security risk to the whole cluster. Containers should only request those privileges they need to run their legitimate functions. No containers will be allowed to run with full privileges without an exception.

The general guidelines are:

. Only ask for the necessary privileges and access control settings for your application.

. If the function required by your workload can be fulfilled by OCP components, your application should not be requesting escalated privilege to perform this function.

. Avoid using any host system resource if possible.

. Leveraging read only root filesystem when possible.

Only ask for the necessary privileges and access control settings for your application

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-security-context-non-root-user-id-check[access-control-security-context-non-root-user-id-check]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Running containers as root increases the blast radius of security vulnerabilities and can lead to full host compromise if containers are breached.

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Allowing privilege escalation can lead to containers gaining root access, compromising the security boundary between containers and hosts.

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Host IPC access allows containers to communicate with host processes, potentially exposing sensitive information and enabling privilege escalation.

Do not mount host directories for device access.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-pod-host-path[access-control-pod-host-path]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Host path mounts can expose sensitive host files to containers, enable container escape attacks, and compromise host system integrity.

Do not use host network namespace.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-namespace[access-control-namespace]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Using inappropriate namespaces can lead to resource conflicts, security boundary violations, and administrative complexity in multi-tenant environments.

Workloads may not modify the platform in any way.

See test cases link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#platform-alteration-base-image[platform-alteration-base-image], link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#platform-alteration-sysctl-config[platform-alteration-sysctl-config]

**Impacts and Risks of Non-Compliance:** Modified base images can introduce security vulnerabilities, create inconsistent behavior, and violate immutable infrastructure principles.
